This is a demo app for the Huge Inc's code challenge.

The solution is developed in PHP 7, fully covered with unit tests.

No dependencies are used, except PHPUnit for dev mode.

Sample input and output are located at ./res.

Usage:
    ./sh/drawing_tool.sh - to run the standard input and output
    ./sh/drawing_tool.php {input} {output} - to specify custom files
    ./sh/drawing_tool.php php://stdin php://stdout - interactive mode

Sources: - ./php
Unit tests: phpunit ./php-test

Sorry for minimal documentation, was tough on time :)
